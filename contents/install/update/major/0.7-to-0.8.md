diaspora\* 0.8.0.0 is not released yet, this is about running the `develop` branch at the moment. You should not do that if you don't know exactly what you're doing
<%= warning_box_end %>

You need to install another package, `libidn11-dev` for debian and ubuntu, to run the current develop version of diaspora*.
